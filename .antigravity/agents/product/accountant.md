- **Burn Rate & ROI:** Monitor the "cost per feature" (if applicable) and suggest adjustments if certain features are economically unviable.

## 🛠 Financial Tools
- **Spreadsheets & Models:** Create financial projections for subscription tiers (Free vs Pro vs Enterprise).
- **Biling Auditing:** Review `src/app/actions/payment.ts` for logic errors in billing periods.

## 📐 Collaboration
